# What is Binary?

## **Introduction**

Binary is a base-2 numeral system that uses only two digits: 0 and 1. It serves as the foundation of digital technology
and computer systems. Every piece of data processed by a computer—whether text, images, or videos—is represented in
binary. Understanding binary is essential for grasping how computers store, process, and transmit information.

## **What is Binary?**

Binary is a numerical system that operates on base-2, unlike the decimal system, which is base-10. It uses only two
symbols: 0 and 1, which are known as bits (short for binary digits). These bits represent the *on* and *off* states in
electronic circuits, making binary a natural fit for computers and digital systems.

## **How Binary Works**

Each digit in a binary number represents a power of 2, starting from the rightmost digit (similar to how each digit in a
decimal number represents a power of 10).

For example, the binary number **1011** can be expanded as:  
\[ 1 \times 2^3 + 0 \times 2^2 + 1 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0 = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11 \ (decimal) \]

## **Binary vs. Decimal System**

| Feature            | Binary (Base-2) | Decimal (Base-10) |
|--------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Symbols Used**   | 0, 1            | 0, 1, 2, ..., 9   |
| **Representation** | Powers of 2     | Powers of 10      |
| **Example**        | 1011 = 11       | 11 = 11           |

Binary is simpler for machines to process but less intuitive for humans compared to the decimal system.

## **Applications of Binary in Computing**

**Data Representation**  
Binary encodes data such as text, images, and videos into sequences of 0s and 1s. For instance:

- ASCII code represents characters like 'A' as binary numbers (e.g., **01000001**).

**Logic Gates and Circuits**  
Computers use binary to represent logical operations in hardware, using gates like AND, OR, and NOT.

**File Formats**  
Every file on a computer, from documents to executables, is stored as a sequence of binary data.

## **Converting Binary to Decimal and Vice Versa**

**Binary to Decimal**  
Expand each binary digit using powers of 2. For example:

**Binary:** 1101  
\[ (1 \times 2^3) + (1 \times 2^2) + (0 \times 2^1) + (1 \times 2^0) = 13 \ (decimal) \]

**Decimal to Binary**  
Divide the decimal number by 2, recording the remainder, until the quotient is 0. Then reverse the remainders.

Example: Convert 13 to binary.

1. 13 ÷ 2 = 6 remainder 1
2. 6 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 0
3. 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1
4. 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1  
   **Binary:** 1101

## **Conclusion**

Binary is the fundamental language of computers, shaping how digital systems function and communicate. While it might
seem abstract, binary's simplicity allows machines to perform complex operations with incredible speed and accuracy. By
understanding binary, we can better appreciate the inner workings of the technology that powers our modern world.
