# What is Husky?

When working on software projects, especially in teams, it’s essential to maintain high-quality code and ensure consistent practices across the team. This is where **Husky** comes in. Husky is a popular tool in the development community that allows developers to easily manage and run Git hooks for their projects. By integrating Husky into your workflow, you can automate common tasks like code formatting, linting, and testing, making it easier to maintain code quality and catch issues before they reach the repository.

In this article, we'll dive into what Husky is, how it works, and why it’s a valuable addition to your development toolkit.

## **Understanding Git Hooks**

Before we discuss Husky, it's helpful to understand **Git hooks**. Git hooks are scripts that are automatically triggered by Git at specific stages in your development process. They can run before or after certain Git actions, such as making a commit, pushing code, or merging branches. Git hooks are powerful for enforcing best practices, running tests, or checking code quality before allowing code to be committed or pushed.

Some common Git hooks include:
- **pre-commit**: Runs before a commit is created.
- **commit-msg**: Runs after the commit message is entered, often used to check the format of the commit message.
- **pre-push**: Runs before pushing code to a remote repository, useful for running tests or lint checks.

Git hooks are great, but they can be challenging to set up and maintain across a team. This is where Husky simplifies the process.

## **What is Husky?**

**Husky** is a JavaScript-based tool that makes it easy to manage Git hooks within your project. It allows you to configure Git hooks in your project's configuration file (such as `package.json`), automating tasks like code linting, formatting, and testing. Husky's primary goal is to streamline the setup of Git hooks so that they’re consistent, easy to maintain, and enforced across all team members working on a project.

With Husky, you can ensure that every team member follows the same guidelines, reducing code quality issues and avoiding repetitive manual tasks.

## **Benefits of Using Husky**

Using Husky in your development workflow offers multiple benefits:

### 1. **Consistency Across the Team**
Husky helps maintain a uniform coding style and practices across all team members by enforcing Git hooks. This leads to cleaner and more consistent code, which is easier to read, review, and maintain.

### 2. **Automated Quality Checks**
By running linters, tests, or formatters through Git hooks, Husky helps catch issues early in the development process. For example, you can set up a pre-commit hook to automatically run code linters, ensuring that no linting errors slip into the codebase.

### 3. **Improved Code Quality**
Husky enforces coding standards and best practices by running tasks like linting and testing automatically, which helps improve the overall quality of the code in the repository.

### 4. **Enhanced Workflow Automation**
Husky can save time by automating repetitive tasks. Instead of running linting or tests manually before every commit or push, you can configure Husky to handle these tasks automatically, streamlining the development workflow.

## **Getting Started with Husky**

Setting up Husky is straightforward, especially if you’re using npm or Yarn. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to get started:

### 1. **Install Husky**

First, install Husky as a development dependency in your project:
```bash
npm install husky --save-dev
```
or
```bash
yarn add husky --dev
```

### 2. **Activate Git Hooks**

After installing Husky, you’ll need to initialize Git hooks in your project:
```bash
npx husky install
```

This creates a `.husky` directory in the root of your project, where your hook scripts will be stored.

### 3. **Add a Hook**

Let’s add a pre-commit hook to run linting before each commit. You can create the hook with the following command:
```bash
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npm run lint"
```

Now, every time a commit is created, Husky will run `npm run lint` to ensure your code meets the linting standards.

### 4. **Configure Husky in package.json**

You can also add Husky configuration directly to your `package.json` file, although the `.husky` directory setup is recommended:
```json
"husky": {
  "hooks": {
    "pre-commit": "npm run lint",
    "pre-push": "npm run test"
  }
}
```

This configuration ensures that Husky runs linting before each commit and testing before each push.

## **Common Use Cases for Husky**

Here are a few popular ways developers use Husky to improve their workflows:

### 1. **Code Formatting and Linting**

A pre-commit hook can automatically run a linter (e.g., ESLint for JavaScript) or formatter (e.g., Prettier) to ensure that code meets your project's style guide. This helps keep the codebase clean and consistent.

```bash
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npm run lint && npm run format"
```

### 2. **Running Tests**

You can use a pre-push hook to run tests before pushing code to the remote repository. This helps prevent code with failing tests from reaching the shared repository.

```bash
npx husky add .husky/pre-push "npm test"
```

### 3. **Checking Commit Messages**

Using a commit-msg hook, you can ensure that all commit messages follow a specific format, like the Conventional Commits standard. This is particularly helpful for teams that rely on commit messages for auto-generating changelogs.

```bash
npx husky add .husky/commit-msg 'npx commitlint --edit "$1"'
```

## **Example: Using Husky with Lint-Staged**

Husky works well with **lint-staged**, a tool that allows you to run linters only on files staged for commit. Here’s an example setup to use Husky and lint-staged together:

1. Install lint-staged:
   ```bash
   npm install lint-staged --save-dev
   ```

2. Configure lint-staged in `package.json`:
   ```json
   "lint-staged": {
     "*.js": [
       "eslint --fix",
       "prettier --write"
     ]
   }
   ```

3. Add a pre-commit hook with Husky:
   ```bash
   npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npx lint-staged"
   ```

Now, when you create a commit, lint-staged will only run on the files that have been modified, which can speed up the commit process.

## **Best Practices for Using Husky**

- **Keep Hooks Simple**: Avoid adding too many tasks to a single hook, as this can slow down your workflow. Aim to keep hooks focused and efficient.
- **Combine with Other Tools**: Husky works well with other tools like lint-staged, Prettier, and ESLint, so consider combining them for more streamlined workflows.
- **Monitor Performance**: Running many tasks in a hook can impact performance, so test your hooks to ensure they run efficiently without significantly delaying commits or pushes.
- **Share Configurations**: For team projects, use a shared configuration (such as in `package.json`) to ensure consistent rules across all developers.

---

## **Conclusion**

Husky is an essential tool for automating code quality checks and enforcing best practices in development workflows. By leveraging Git hooks, Husky helps prevent issues before they reach your main repository, promoting better coding habits and a more efficient workflow. Whether you’re a solo developer or part of a team, using Husky can streamline your development process and improve the overall quality of your codebase.

If you’re looking to maintain high-quality code while reducing manual tasks, integrating Husky into your project is a smart choice that will pay off in the long run. Start using Husky, and take advantage of the power of Git hooks to keep your project consistent, reliable, and efficient.
