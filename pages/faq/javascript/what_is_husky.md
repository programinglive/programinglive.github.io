# What is Husky?

**Husky** is a popular tool in the JavaScript ecosystem that helps developers manage **Git hooks**. Git hooks are custom scripts that are executed automatically at specific stages of the Git workflow, such as before commits, after pushes, or before merging. Husky simplifies the process of integrating Git hooks into a project, allowing teams to enforce code quality standards, run tests, or automate tasks efficiently.

## 1. Introduction

Managing code quality and workflow consistency is crucial in collaborative projects. Git hooks are a powerful way to automate such tasks, but setting them up manually can be complex and error-prone. Husky provides a simple way to manage Git hooks in JavaScript projects, leveraging **npm** or **yarn** for configuration and execution.

---

## 2. What Are Git Hooks?

Git hooks are **scripts** triggered by specific events in the Git lifecycle. Examples include:
- **`pre-commit`**: Runs before a commit is finalized.
- **`pre-push`**: Executes before code is pushed to a remote repository.
- **`commit-msg`**: Validates commit messages.

These hooks can be used for tasks such as:
1. Running linters (e.g., ESLint).
2. Executing tests before commits or pushes.
3. Enforcing commit message conventions.

## 3. Key Features of Husky

1. **Simplifies Git Hook Management**  
   Eliminates the need for manual configuration of Git hooks.

2. **Integrates with JavaScript Ecosystem**  
   Works seamlessly with tools like ESLint, Prettier, and testing libraries.

3. **Lightweight and Flexible**  
   Hooks are defined in the project’s configuration file, allowing easy customization.

4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**  
   Husky works on all major operating systems.

---

## 4. Why Use Husky?

Husky ensures a consistent workflow across a team by automating repetitive tasks, reducing human error, and enforcing best practices. It’s particularly useful for:
- Preventing poorly formatted or failing code from being committed.
- Enforcing team coding standards through automated checks.
- Running pre-push tests to avoid breaking changes in shared branches.

## 5. How to Install and Use Husky

### Installation
Husky requires Node.js and npm (or yarn) to be installed.

1. Install Husky via npm:
   ```bash
   npm install husky --save-dev
   ```

2. Enable Husky in your project:
   ```bash
   npx husky install
   ```

3. Add a script to your `package.json` to ensure Husky gets installed automatically after dependencies:
   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "prepare": "husky install"
     }
   }
   ```

### Configuring Hooks
Husky hooks can be created using the `husky add` command.

1. Create a pre-commit hook to run a linter:
   ```bash
   npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npm run lint"
   ```

2. Create a pre-push hook to run tests:
   ```bash
   npx husky add .husky/pre-push "npm test"
   ```

3. Validate commit messages with a commit-msg hook:
   ```bash
   npx husky add .husky/commit-msg "npx commitlint --edit $1"
   ```

---

## 6. Examples of Husky in Action

### Running ESLint Before Committing
Add a `pre-commit` hook:
```bash
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npx eslint ."
```

### Enforcing Commit Message Standards
Install **commitlint**:
```bash
npm install @commitlint/config-conventional @commitlint/cli --save-dev
```

Create a `commit-msg` hook:
```bash
npx husky add .husky/commit-msg "npx commitlint --edit $1"
```

---

## 7. Benefits of Husky

1. **Improved Code Quality**  
   Automates the enforcement of standards and practices.

2. **Team Consistency**  
   Ensures all contributors follow the same workflow.

3. **Error Prevention**  
   Catches issues early, before code is pushed to the repository.

4. **Integration-Friendly**  
   Works well with existing tools like linters, formatters, and test suites.

## 8. Conclusion

Husky is a powerful and easy-to-use tool for managing Git hooks in JavaScript projects. By automating common tasks like linting, testing, and commit validation, it improves workflow consistency and code quality. Whether you’re working solo or in a team, Husky simplifies your development process and ensures best practices are followed seamlessly.
