### **Introduction**

Hexadecimal, often abbreviated as **hex**, is a base-16 numeral system. Unlike the decimal system, which uses ten
digits (0–9), hexadecimal uses sixteen symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F. It’s widely used in
computing as a more human-readable representation of binary numbers, simplifying the way large binary values are
expressed.

### **How Hexadecimal Works**

Each position in a hexadecimal number corresponds to a power of 16, starting from \( 16^0 \) at the rightmost position.

**Example:**  
Hexadecimal: `2A3`  
Calculation:  
(2 × 16<sup>2</sup>) + (10 × 16<sup>1</sup>) + (3 × 16<sup>0</sup>)  
= 512 + 160 + 3  
= 675 (decimal)

In computing, hexadecimal is often used to represent binary values more compactly since one hexadecimal digit
corresponds to exactly four binary bits.

### **Hexadecimal vs. Decimal and Binary**

| Feature            | Hexadecimal (Base-16) | Decimal (Base-10) | Binary (Base-2) |
|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Symbols Used**   | 0–9, A–F              | 0–9               | 0, 1            |
| **Representation** | Powers of 16          | Powers of 10      | Powers of 2     |
| **Example Value**  | `2A` = 42             | 42                | `101010`        |

### **Applications of Hexadecimal in Computing**

**Memory Addressing**  
Hexadecimal is commonly used to represent memory addresses in programming because it’s more compact and easier to read
than binary.

**Color Codes**  
In web design, colors are often defined using hexadecimal codes. For instance:

- `#FFFFFF` represents white (Red: 255, Green: 255, Blue: 255).
- `#000000` represents black (Red: 0, Green: 0, Blue: 0).

**Error Codes**  
System and application errors often use hexadecimal codes for debugging.

**Machine Language**  
Hexadecimal simplifies representing large binary sequences used in assembly and machine language.

### **Converting Between Hexadecimal, Decimal, and Binary**

**Hexadecimal to Decimal**  
(3 × 16<sup>1</sup>) + (14 × 16<sup>0</sup>)  
= 48 + 14  
= 62 (decimal)

**Hexadecimal to Binary**  
Replace each hex digit with its 4-bit binary equivalent.  
Example: Convert `2F` to binary.  
2 = 0010  
F = 1111  
Result: 2F in binary is 00101111

**Binary to Hexadecimal**  
Group binary digits in sets of four (from right to left) and convert each group to a hex digit.  
Example: Convert `11011011` to hexadecimal.  
Group: 1101 1011  
Convert: 1101 = D, 1011 = B  
Result: 11011011 in hex is DB

### **Conclusion**

Hexadecimal is an essential numeral system in computing, offering a compact and readable way to represent binary data.
Its applications, from memory addressing to color representation, highlight its importance in technology. By
understanding hexadecimal, you gain a deeper insight into how computers operate at a fundamental level.
