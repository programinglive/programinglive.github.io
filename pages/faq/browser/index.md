# What is a Browser?

A **browser** is a software application that allows users to access, retrieve, and view content on the World Wide Web. Think of it as the gateway to the internet—it translates the code behind websites into the interactive pages we see and use every day.

Popular browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge, and Opera.

## How Does a Browser Work?

When you type a website address (URL) into the browser’s address bar, the browser:
1. **Translates the URL into an IP address** by contacting a DNS (Domain Name System) server.
2. **Sends a request to the server** hosting the website.
3. **Receives and processes the website’s code** (usually [HTML](./../../../tutorial/web/html/index.md), [CSS](./../../../tutorial/web/css/index.md), and [JavaScript](./../../../tutorial/web/javascript/index.md)).
4. **Renders the webpage** on your screen, allowing you to interact with it.

This entire process happens in seconds, thanks to the browser’s efficiency.
