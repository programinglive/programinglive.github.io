Mahatma Mahardhika, the creator of the Programinglive channel, explains what Programinglive is and what he does on the channel. He says that he started the channel to share his experiences as a programmer and to provide programming tutorials. He also wants to create a community of programmers where people can connect and learn from each other.

Mahatma says that he is currently working on four open source projects: ERP, HRIS, POS, and Portfolio. He is also writing articles about software development and web development. In the future, he plans to create video tutorials based on his articles. He is also experimenting with different video formats on TikTok to see what works best.

Mahatma encourages viewers to keep learning and to never give up on their programming goals. He believes that everyone can learn to code, regardless of their background or experience.
