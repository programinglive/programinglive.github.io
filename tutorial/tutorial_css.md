# Tutorial CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to control the layout and appearance of web pages written in HTML or XML. CSS is used to separate the presentation of a document from its structure, which is written in HTML or a similar markup language. This allows web designers to define the look of a web page and its layout without having to write a lot of HTML code.

### CSS syntax

The syntax of CSS consists of a series of rules, known as styles, which are applied to elements on a web page. A style consists of a selector and a declaration block. The selector specifies the element(s) to which the style applies, and the declaration block defines the properties and values of the style.

The syntax of a CSS rule is as follows:

```css
selector {
    property: value;
}
```

### CSS properties

The properties in CSS are used to control the appearance of an element. The properties can be set using the `property` and `value` pair. The properties are separated by a `:` symbol.

```css
selector {
    color: red;
}
```
