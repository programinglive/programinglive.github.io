## Git Hook: Automate Tasks with Git

Git is a widely popular version control system among developers. However, one feature often overlooked is **Git Hooks**. Git Hooks are scripts that can be automatically triggered by specific Git events. By using Git Hooks, you can automate repetitive tasks or ensure code standards are met before pushing to a repository.

### What is a Git Hook?

Git Hooks are scripts that you can add to a Git repository to handle specific events like commits, pushes, and merges. These scripts are stored in the `.git/hooks` folder in each repository. When a particular Git event occurs, Git will check this folder to see if there is a matching hook to run.

### Types of Git Hooks

Git Hooks are divided into two types:
1. **Client-Side Hooks**: Operate locally and handle actions like `commit` and `merge`. They’re commonly used to automate code checks (linting), testing, and more.
2. **Server-Side Hooks**: Run on the Git server and handle actions like `push` and `receive`. These are useful for enforcing repository rules, such as checking commit formats or specific branches.

Some commonly used hooks include:
- **pre-commit**: Runs before a commit is created. It’s often used to check code formatting or catch minor bugs before saving code.
- **pre-push**: Runs before code is pushed to the server. This hook can be used to run automated tests or other verifications.
- **commit-msg**: Runs when creating a commit to check the commit message format.

### Examples of Using Git Hooks

#### 1. Automatic Linting with a Pre-Commit Hook

Suppose you want to ensure that every committed code has passed linting. You can use a `pre-commit` hook:

1. Create a `.git/hooks/pre-commit` file.
2. Add the following code to enable linting (example using ESLint):

    ```bash
    #!/bin/sh
    eslint .
    ```

3. Make sure the file is executable by running `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`.

With this setup, every time you make a commit, Git will automatically run linting.

#### 2. Automated Testing with a Pre-Push Hook

To ensure that code is bug-free, you can add a `pre-push` hook that runs automated tests before pushing to the server:

1. Create a `.git/hooks/pre-push` file.
2. Add a command to run tests (e.g., with npm):

    ```bash
    #!/bin/sh
    npm test
    ```

3. Set the file to executable: `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push`.

With this setup, only code that has passed automated tests can be pushed to the server.

### Benefits of Using Git Hooks

- **Reduce Errors**: Automating checks before commit or push can help reduce bugs or coding errors.
- **Consistent Code Standards**: With automatic linting, teams can ensure code follows the same standards.
- **Increased Productivity**: Git Hooks handle repetitive processes, so developers can focus more on actual development.

### Tips for Effective Git Hooks

- **Use Tools Like Husky**: For JavaScript projects, you can use libraries like [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky) to manage Git Hooks more easily.
- **Store Git Hook Scripts in the Repository**: To ensure all team members have the same hooks, store scripts outside `.git/hooks` and use tools like Husky for more flexible management.
- **Limit Checks on Commit or Push**: Too many processes can make committing slow. Only choose the essential checks for hooks.

### Conclusion

Git Hooks are a simple yet powerful feature for improving the development workflow. By setting up Git Hooks, you can ensure that code is always structured, meets standards, and is bug-free. Git Hooks also provide flexibility for automating other tasks, making development more efficient and collaborative.
