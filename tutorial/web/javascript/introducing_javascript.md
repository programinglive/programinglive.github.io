## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a **high-level**, **interpreted** programming language primarily used for web development. Initially
designed to make web pages interactive, it has grown into a versatile language used for:

- Web development (frontend and backend).
- Mobile app development.
- Desktop applications.
- Game development.

## Why Learn JavaScript?

JavaScript is a cornerstone of modern web development, alongside HTML and CSS. Here's why you should learn it:

- **Ubiquity**: It runs on almost every device with a browser.
- **Versatility**: Can be used for both frontend and backend development (e.g., Node.js).
- **Demand**: JavaScript developers are highly sought after in the tech industry.
- **Community**: A vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, like React, Angular, and Vue.

## JavaScript vs Other Web Technologies

| **Feature** | **HTML**                  | **CSS**              | **JavaScript**               |  
|-------------|---------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|  
| Purpose     | Structure of the web page | Styling the web page | Interactivity and logic      |  
| Example     | `<h1>Hello World</h1>`    | `h1 { color: red; }` | `alert('Hello World!');`     |  
| Runs On     | Browser                   | Browser              | Browser and server (Node.js) |

## Key Features of JavaScript

1. **Lightweight and Fast**: JavaScript executes directly in the browser without needing compilation.
2. **Dynamic Typing**: No need to define variable types explicitly.
3. **Event-Driven**: Reacts to user actions like clicks or key presses.
4. **Asynchronous Programming**: Handles tasks like fetching data without blocking other operations.
5. **Cross-Platform**: Runs on any device with a browser or JavaScript engine.

## Basic Structure of a JavaScript Program

### Including JavaScript in HTML

You can include JavaScript in your HTML file in two ways:

1. **Inline Script**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>JavaScript Example</title>
</head>
<body>
<button onclick="alert('Hello, World!')">Click Me</button>
</body>
</html>
```  

2. **External Script**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>JavaScript Example</title>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
<button id="myButton">Click Me</button>
</body>
</html>
```  

In `script.js`:

```javascript
document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", () => {
	alert("Hello, World!");
});
```  

### Example: Displaying a Message

```javascript
let name = "Alice";
console.log("Hello, " + name);
```

## Conclusion

JavaScript is an indispensable tool for building modern web applications. Whether you're creating simple animations or
complex web platforms, JavaScript provides the foundation for dynamic, interactive experiences.
