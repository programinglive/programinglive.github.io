## Definition and Purpose

A **media query** allows you to test for certain conditions, such as screen size, resolution, or orientation, and apply
styles accordingly. They are a cornerstone of responsive design, ensuring that your website looks great on all devices,
from smartphones to desktops.

---

## Basic Syntax of Media Queries

The syntax of a media query includes:

1. The `@media` rule.
2. The media type (e.g., `screen`, `print`).
3. A condition (e.g., `max-width: 768px`).
4. A block of CSS rules to apply when the condition is true.

Example:

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    body {
        background-color: lightblue;
    }
}
```  

This rule applies a light blue background when the screen width is 768px or smaller.

## Using Media Queries in CSS

### Targeting Screen Sizes

You can create styles for different device sizes using `max-width` or `min-width`.

```css
@media (max-width: 600px) {
    body {
        font-size: 14px;
    }
}

@media (min-width: 601px) and (max-width: 1200px) {
    body {
        font-size: 18px;
    }
}
```  

### Targeting Orientation

Use media queries to style based on device orientation (`portrait` or `landscape`).

```css
@media (orientation: portrait) {
    body {
        background-color: pink;
    }
}

@media (orientation: landscape) {
    body {
        background-color: lightgreen;
    }
}
```  

### Combining Media Queries

You can combine multiple conditions using `and`, `not`, or `or`.

```css
@media (min-width: 768px) and (orientation: landscape) {
    body {
        margin: 20px;
    }
}
```

## Practical Examples

### Responsive Grid

Adjust a grid layout based on the screen size.

```css
.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
    .container {
        grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
    }
}

@media (min-width: 1200px) {
    .container {
        grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
    }
}
```  

### Hide Navigation Menu on Small Screens

Hide a menu for smaller devices and replace it with a hamburger icon.

```css
.nav-menu {
    display: block;
}

.hamburger {
    display: none;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .nav-menu {
        display: none;
    }

    .hamburger {
        display: block;
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Media queries are a powerful tool for creating responsive web designs. By tailoring styles to different devices and
conditions, you ensure an optimal user experience regardless of the user's device.
