# What is Web Development?

Web development refers to the process of creating and maintaining websites. It involves various disciplines and technologies that work together to deliver a seamless user experience. At its core, web development is divided into three main areas:

1. **Front-End Development**  
   This focuses on the parts of a website that users interact with directly, such as layouts, navigation, and design elements. Technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are essential here.

2. **Back-End Development**  
   The back-end is the server-side of a website. It manages data and ensures smooth communication between the server and the browser. Common back-end technologies include PHP, Python, Node.js, and databases like MySQL or MongoDB.

3. **Full-Stack Development**  
   Full-stack developers are proficient in both front-end and back-end development, allowing them to build and manage complete web applications.
