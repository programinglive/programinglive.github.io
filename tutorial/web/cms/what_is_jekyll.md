# Jekyll

**Jekyll** is an open-source static site generator written in Ruby. It is primarily used to transform plain text files,
like Markdown or HTML, into static websites or blogs. Jekyll is popular for its simplicity, speed, and integration with
GitHub Pages, making it a great choice for developers, bloggers, and users who want a fast and efficient way to build
static websites without relying on databases or dynamic content generation.

## What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static site generator that transforms plain text files, such as Markdown, into static websites. Static sites
are composed of fixed content that does not change unless a new version is deployed. Unlike traditional CMS platforms,
which generate dynamic pages from a database on each request, static sites like those built with Jekyll are pre-rendered
into HTML files.

Jekyll takes content (e.g., blog posts, pages, and other content) written in Markdown or HTML, applies templates to
them, and generates static web pages that are ready to be served to users.

## How Jekyll Works

The process of how Jekyll works can be summarized as follows:

1. **Content Creation**: You write content in Markdown, HTML, or other supported formats. These files are stored in a
   content directory.
2. **Template Usage**: Jekyll uses a templating system called **Liquid** to apply layouts and styles to the content. The
   templates define how pages and posts are structured, including elements like headers, footers, and sidebars.
3. **Static Site Generation**: Jekyll processes the content and templates, and then compiles them into static HTML
   files. These files can be hosted on any web server or service like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or your own hosting
   provider.
4. **Deployment**: The resulting HTML files, along with assets like images, CSS, and JavaScript, are ready to be
   deployed.

Since Jekyll generates static files, the resulting website is fast and secure because there is no database or
server-side scripting involved in the generation of pages.

## Key Features of Jekyll

### 1. **Markdown Support**

Jekyll allows you to write your content in **Markdown**, a lightweight markup language that is simple to read and write.
Markdown files are then converted into HTML during the site generation process.

### 2. **Layouts and Templates**

Jekyll uses **Liquid** templating language to define layouts and templates. This makes it easy to apply consistent
structure to the website, such as headers, footers, and navigation menus.

### 3. **Plugins and Extensions**

Jekyll supports plugins that can extend its functionality. For example, you can use plugins to integrate with
third-party services, improve SEO, or add custom features to your site.

### 4. **Data Files**

Jekyll allows you to include **YAML**, **JSON**, or **CSV** data files that can be used to dynamically generate content
in your site. This feature is useful for creating structured content, such as a list of team members or a portfolio.

### 5. **GitHub Pages Integration**

Jekyll is tightly integrated with **GitHub Pages**, allowing you to host static websites directly from a GitHub
repository. This integration makes it easy to deploy websites for free.

### 6. **Built-in Support for Blogging**

Jekyll is often used for building blogs. It includes built-in support for managing posts, including features like
categories, tags, and archives.

### 7. **Version Control Friendly**

Since Jekyll generates static files, the content and code can be managed via Git, making it easy to track changes,
collaborate, and roll back to previous versions.

## Benefits of Using Jekyll

### 1. **Speed and Performance**

Since Jekyll generates static websites, the pages are pre-rendered and ready to be served directly to users. This makes
Jekyll sites very fast because there is no need for server-side processing or database queries.

### 2. **Simplicity and Ease of Use**

Jekyll's simplicity makes it easy to set up and use, especially for developers. You don't need a complex server-side
language or database to build a website, just basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Markdown.

### 3. **No Database Required**

Unlike traditional CMS platforms, Jekyll does not require a database. All content is stored as text files in your
project directory, making it easy to maintain and version control.

### 4. **Security**

Static websites are less vulnerable to attacks because there is no database or dynamic content generation process. Since
the site is simply a set of HTML files, the risk of common security vulnerabilities (such as SQL injection) is
minimized.

### 5. **Version Control and Collaboration**

Jekyll integrates well with version control systems like Git. This makes it easy to track changes to your site,
collaborate with others, and deploy updates.

### 6. **Scalability**

Because Jekyll sites are static, they can easily be scaled to handle high amounts of traffic. Static files can be
distributed across a content delivery network (CDN) to ensure fast load times worldwide.

### 7. **Cost-Effective Hosting**

Jekyll sites can be hosted on GitHub Pages for free, or on any static file hosting service such as Netlify or Amazon S3.
Since there’s no need for a server or database, the hosting costs are minimal.

## Jekyll vs. Traditional CMS

### 1. **Database-Driven vs. Static Files**

Traditional CMS platforms (like WordPress, Joomla, or Drupal) rely on databases to store and retrieve content
dynamically when a page is requested. Jekyll, on the other hand, generates static HTML files from content at build time,
which means faster performance and fewer security risks.

### 2. **Ease of Use**

Traditional CMS platforms come with user-friendly admin interfaces, allowing users to easily create, edit, and publish
content through a graphical interface. Jekyll, however, requires users to write content in Markdown files and work with
Git for version control.

### 3. **Customization and Extensibility**

While Jekyll is highly customizable, it does require knowledge of HTML, CSS, and programming to make full use of its
capabilities. Traditional CMS platforms typically have a wider range of plugins and themes, and are easier for
non-technical users to customize.

### 4. **Maintenance**

Jekyll requires minimal maintenance, as it is a static site generator with no underlying database. Traditional CMS
platforms, however, require regular updates for plugins, themes, and the core system to keep them secure and functioning
correctly.

## Setting Up Jekyll

Here’s a basic overview of how to set up Jekyll:

### 1. **Install Jekyll**

First, install Ruby (since Jekyll is written in Ruby) and then install Jekyll via the terminal:

```bash
gem install jekyll bundler
```

### 2. **Create a New Jekyll Site**

Create a new Jekyll project by running the following command:

```bash
jekyll new my-awesome-site
```

### 3. **Build and Serve**

Navigate to your project directory and build your site with:

```bash
cd my-awesome-site
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

This will start a local development server at `http://localhost:4000`, where you can preview your site.

### 4. **Deploy**

Once you're ready, deploy your site to a hosting provider like **GitHub Pages** or **Netlify** by pushing the generated
static files.
