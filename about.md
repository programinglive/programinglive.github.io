### **About Us**

Hello, my name is **[Mahatma Mahardhika](https://github.com/mahatmamahardhikach)**.

Currently, I am working to build a community for programmers in Indonesia. I know it's a challenging journey, but I believe this effort is worth pursuing. With Indonesia experiencing a demographic bonus, the demand for skilled programmers will continue to grow in the future. That's why this community exists—to support and empower the next generation of programmers.

### **Our Vision**

Our vision is to become the **largest and most impactful programming community in Indonesia**, with a focus on nurturing newcomers. We’ve observed that many beginners often make fundamental mistakes, such as:
- Learning solely to get rich.
- Studying without a clear purpose.
- Pursuing programming because of peer influence.

To address this, we aim to:
1. **Collect valuable and practical information** for beginners.
2. Organize it into **informative articles**.
3. Transform the content into **engaging video tutorials**.

By providing accessible resources and guidance, we hope to inspire newcomers to approach programming with the right mindset and a solid foundation.

I understand it’s still early to officially announce this movement, but we are committed to doing our best to improve and grow over time. Our ultimate goal is to serve all stakeholders effectively—whether they are beginners, professionals, or organizations in need of skilled developers.
