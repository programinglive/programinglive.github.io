# Human Resource Information System (HRIS)

The **Human Resource Information System (HRIS)** is a **web application** designed to support the management of human
resources within a company. HRIS simplifies and streamlines various HR functions, including managing employee data,
tracking attendance, processing salaries, and organizing employee training programs.

This HRIS project is **open source** and a part of the **ProgrammingLive Community**, a collaborative platform dedicated
to building and sharing software solutions. As an open-source initiative, the HRIS project encourages contributions from
developers worldwide to enhance its features, improve its functionality, and adapt it to the diverse needs of
organizations.

Additionally, HRIS is designed to support **multi-tenant architecture** and can be deployed as a *
*Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)** platform. With a single root company managing the system, multiple tenants (
sub-companies or clients) can access and operate their isolated environments within the same application instance. This
makes it ideal for shared service providers, HR consultancies, or organizations with multiple subsidiaries.
